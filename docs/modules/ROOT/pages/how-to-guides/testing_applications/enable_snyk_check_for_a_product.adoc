= Enabling a Snyk task

[abstract]
The `sast-snyk-check` task uses the Snyk Code tool to perform static application security testing (SAST). 
Specifically, the Snyk check scans an application's source code for potential security vulnerabilities, 
including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection attack vulnerabilities.

> NOTE: You can run a Snyk task only if you have a Snyk token stored in a namespace secret. 
You should also include the name of your secret in the *snyk-secret* pipeline parameter.

== Prerequisites
- You have CLI access to the specific OpenShift cluster. For information on obtaining CLI access, refer to  xref:../../getting-started/getting_started_in_cli.adoc[Getting started in CLI]
- You have an up-to-date kubectl binary. Alternatively, the `oc` binary is also compatible.
